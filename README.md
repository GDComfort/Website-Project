# Website Project
Website Project for a Web Design class. The goal was to create a fictitious website of a school and what it might have, and then adding progressively to it over time.

All names, phone numbers, email and copyright's within the html files or other were fabricated purely for the project itself. Any real references to a "Charle's Cooking School" is purely coincidental.
