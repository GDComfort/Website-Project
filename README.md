# Website Project
Website Project for a Web Design class. The goal was to create a fictitious website of a school and what it might have, and then adding progressively to it over time.

All names and copyright's within the html files or other were fabricated purely for the project itself. Any real references to a "Charle's Cooking School" is purely coincidental, as well as any references to an email which was also fabricated purely for the sake of the project.
