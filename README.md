# HTML Project
HTML Project for a programming class. The goal was to create a fictitious website of a school and what it might have, and then adding progressively to it over time.

All names and copyright's within the html files or other were fabricated purely for the project itself. Any real references to a "Charle's Cooking School" is purely coincidental.
